<h2>What is Test Clutch?</h2>

Test Clutch is a test run aggregation and analysis system. It continually
collects the results of test runs from Continuous Integration (CI) systems that
run regression tests on newly-committed source code. Those test results are
analyzed and displayed so developers can extract useful information from them
that isn't easily obtained by looking at test runs one at a time.

<p>
It is designed especially for projects with many tests running on (potentially)
many different CI systems. The <a href="https://curl.se/">curl project</a> is a
good example. It has two independent test suites totalling thousands of test
cases that are run on dozens of different build configurations. Every single
code change can cause over 100,000 individual tests to be run on over 100
different servers.  With that many tests being run, even a tiny false
positive rate makes it hard to tell if a failed test is a genuine problem or
just a flaky test. This site is a Test Clutch installation tailored for curl.

<p>
Test Clutch is intended to make testing code just a little bit easier.
See the <a href="https://github.com/dfandrich/testclutch/blob/master/README.md">README file</a>
for a sense of where we're going with this.  It's early days, so come back
often to see how things are progressing!  It's all Open Source, so feel free to
jump in and help out if you share the vision of improving presentation of
test results.
